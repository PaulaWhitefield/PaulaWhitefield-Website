LYRICS

Everyday when I wake up,
I turn on my TV and open YouTube.
Then I scroll through my recommendations,
to see if anyone has posted any new stuff.

I scroll through the list,
passing on all the junk videos.
Then I find one that looks appealing,
so I press on it and it starts playing.

I'm addicted to YouTube!
I watch it every day!
I don't care what others say because,
I'm addicted to YouTube, yes I am!

When the video is done playing,
It makes me very sad.
But I just scroll,
until I find another video, yes!

I'm addicted to YouTube!
I watch it every day!
I don't care what others say because,
I'm addicted to YouTube, yes I am!

I'm addicted to YouTube!
I watch it every day!
I don't care what others say because,
I'm addicted to YouTube, YES I AM!!
